More helpful documents and "cheat sheets" underway. 

## How this repo is organized
- `mindmaps/` . Learning paths and system overviews
- `notes/` . Clear explanations and takeaways by topic
- `projects/` . Hands-on builds that turn concepts into deliverables

This is a living repo. It evolves as I learn, build, and iterate.

Hey there, 
Welcome to my garage. A living learning place where I store, tinker, edit, map, test, and refine ideas, documents, learning aids.  
This repo captures handy basic documents, how a complex topic can be understood and define a solution and everything in between. Starting with no structure, hand written notes, then turning those ideas into hands-on work.

## Start here
### AI/ML App Journey. Code → Train → Deploy
This mind map will help you as a roadmap to start your AI_ML journey. Enjoy !

More helpful documents and "cheat sheets" underway. 

## How this repo is organized
- `mindmaps/` . Learning paths and system overviews
- `notes/` . Clear explanations and takeaways by topic
- `projects/` . Hands-on builds that turn concepts into deliverables

This is a living repo. It evolves as I learn, build, and iterate.
